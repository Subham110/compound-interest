# Compound-interest

Understanding Compound Interest with Code Example
Compound Interest is a powerful concept in finance that refers to the interest calculated on the initial principal, which also includes all the accumulated interest from previous periods on a deposit or loan. This means that you earn interest on both your original investment (or principal) and on the interest that accumulates over time.

# Formula for Compound Interest:

The formula to calculate compound interest is:

A=P×(1+ 
100
r
​
 ) 
t

Where:

A is the amount of money accumulated after 𝑛 n years, including interest.

P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).

r is the annual interest rate (in percentage).

t is the time the money is invested or borrowed for, in years.

# The compound interest (CI) is then calculated as:

CI=A−P
